# Better Task file layout
feature

The words directly connected to the title are the categories or even better
"tags". Tags can only be one word on every line.

Notice the white line between the tags and the description. This is necessary
for easier reading. Not necessary for interpretting the data correctly.

The order of the bottom lines is not strict. It uses the word at the beginning
of the line to determine what the type of the data is.

The deu date format is time since epoch. This is converted when displaying in
list or view. Making it human readable.

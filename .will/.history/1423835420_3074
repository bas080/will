When creating a task the default initial status is inactive. This can be changed
here to clearly state what the status was at creation. To change the status one
can edit the file manually, or use the command.

```bash
will status [TASK|ID]
```

This brings up a list dialog where the user can select to what state the task
should be changed to. It then appends the state change to the task file with the
current date.

Cleanup the code
feature


Reconsidered this again and have implemented the Will class. This contains all
functions concerning the editing of tasks within a .will folder.

Classes and such would be overkill. I have reconsidered it and I will keep the
code flatish.

Important is to reconsider what functions belong to the core and what are
helpers.

The code is losing it's simplicity. It needs a task class and a class to convert the
task files to a class instance.

class Task: (instantiated for every class)
class TaskParser: (static)

This allows for a smarter and more complex commandline tool in the future.

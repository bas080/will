Save changed tasks temporarily in a backup folder


Whenever changes are made to the task it is saved to a backup file with a unique
ID. This id is used in the file log. The id is a combination of unix time since
epoch followed by two numbers. e.g.

1923190_53

Backups are stored indefinately. The backups can be cleaned up manually. They
are exact copies of the file. Thus it can easily be read and brought back from
the grave.

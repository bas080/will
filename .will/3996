logging

Actions that will be logged are changes made during editing the file, removal of
tasks and creation of tasks. Every change creates a carbon copy of the file in
the history folder. This is important for reverting tasks.

---

No longer saving task log in the task file. This should stay a simple human
readable file. The reason being that file changes can be derived by looking at
the log file.

---

Except for saving the changes to the task in the task file, the actions that the
player performs are saved to a log file. This way file changes can be reverted
more easily. Only changes to files are logged. Viewing and listing is not
logged.

To allow reverting the following data is necessary.

The id of the backup file and the id of the task that was changed. A status,
priority, description, deu or title change are all considered as normal file
changes. No distinction is made between the changes. To make reverting easier
the changes also have a title/description. A log entry looks as follows.

TASKID
BACKUPID
DESCRIPTION

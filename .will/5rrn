Create a command for every status

Currently the status is set using the set command. What I am considering is
using a different command for every status. Exampels

- will delegate task... user
- will reject task...
- will terminate task...
- will ready task...
- will expire task... (expiration can also occurs if expiration time is set)
- will forward task...
- will finish task...
- will fail task...
- will complete task...
- will revive task...
- will reject task...
- will reclaim task...

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management

The arrows clearly show what tasks are available in what status. Thus an Inactive
task cannot be assigned directly it must first be Ready. A ready task can be
assigned(delegate), terminated or it can expire. An assigned task can also
expire. Only now the one that has the task determines what happens with the
task. The task can be forwarded. Furthermore he can make the tasks fail or
finish task. The set command will stay as a fail safe feature. This way tasks
statusses can always be hard set.

Show for every status what the possible options are

The status shows the tasks per status. Also show next to the amount the possible
options to change the status of that task. Something like.

  Inactive: 10 ( use "will ready|complete task..." )

Think about a way to store the task and it's possible options. Need a table with
this information.

Something like

def get_task_options( self, task ):
  options = {
    'Inactive' : [ "complete", "ready" ]
    ...
  }

The items in the list are the command and not the statusses. Rconsider using the
statusses and finding another way to get the command connected to that status.

Inactive
